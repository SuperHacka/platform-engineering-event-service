# Event Service

A simple HTTP service for asynchronous event processing with idempotency guarantees.

## What This Service Does

The service provides an HTTP API to accept events, process them asynchronously in the background, and track their status. It implements basic idempotency to prevent duplicate processing of events with the same ID.

**Key Features:**
- Accept events via HTTP POST
- Queue events for background processing
- Track event status (accepted/processed)
- Health and readiness checks
- Graceful shutdown handling

## Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.22 or later

### Start the service

```bash
go run ./...
```

The service will start on port 8080 by default.

### Configuration

The service can be configured via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `8080` | HTTP server port |
| `ENV` | `dev` | Environment (dev/staging/prod) |
| `PROCESSING_DELAY_MS` | `1000` | Simulated processing delay in milliseconds |

Example with custom configuration:

```bash
PORT=3000 ENV=staging PROCESSING_DELAY_MS=500 go run ./...
```

## API Endpoints

### POST /events

Accepts an event for processing.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_123",
  "payload": {
    "any": "data",
    "goes": "here"
  }
}
```

**Responses:**
- `202 Accepted` - Event accepted and queued for processing
- `409 Conflict` - Event with this ID already exists
- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid request body or missing event_id

### GET /health

Returns service health status.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime": "5m32s"
}
```

Always returns `200 OK`.

### GET /ready

Returns readiness status (whether the background worker is running).

**Response (Ready):**
```json
{
  "status": "ready",
  "ready": true
}
```
Returns `200 OK` when ready.

**Response (Not Ready):**
```json
{
  "status": "not ready",
  "ready": false
}
```
Returns `503 Service Unavailable` when not ready.

## Testing the Service

### Using Insomnia (Recommended)

An Insomnia collection is included for easy API testing:

1. Install [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) if you haven't already
2. Import the collection: `File > Import` and select `insomnia-collection.json`
3. The collection includes pre-configured requests for all endpoints:
   - `GET /health` - Check service health
   - `GET /ready` - Check worker readiness
   - `POST /events - New Event` - Create a new event (returns 202)
   - `POST /events - Duplicate Event` - Test idempotency (returns 409)
   - `POST /events - Event 2, 3` - Additional test events
   - `POST /events - Missing event_id` - Test validation (returns 400)
   - `POST /events - Invalid JSON` - Test error handling (returns 400)

The base URL is configured as `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

### Using curl

**Accept an event:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event_id": "evt_001", "payload": {"test": "data"}}'
```

**Try to send the same event again (should return 409):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event_id": "evt_001", "payload": {"test": "data"}}'
```

**Check health:**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
```

**Check readiness:**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/ready
```

**Stop the service:**
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the service is running.

## Important Note: Not Production-Ready

**This service is intentionally not production-ready.** It is designed as starter code for a technical assessment.

### Known Limitations:
- **No persistence**: All event state is stored in memory and will be lost on restart
- **No structured logging**: Uses basic `log.Printf` statements
- **No metrics or observability**: No instrumentation for monitoring
- **No containerization**: No Dockerfile or container support
- **No infrastructure as code**: No Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, etc.
- **Limited error handling**: Basic error responses without detailed error types
- **No rate limiting**: No protection against traffic spikes
- **No authentication/authorization**: Endpoints are completely open
- **Single instance only**: No support for horizontal scaling or distributed processing
- **No dead letter queue**: Failed events are not captured or retried

Candidates are expected to identify and address these gaps as part of the technical assessment.
